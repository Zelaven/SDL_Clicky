# SDL_Clicky
##Simple library for working with GUI in SDL
This is a simple library for working with GUI in SDL. By providing simple and flexible types and methods, the user can compose their own aggregate types for more complex purposes if need be.
The library relies on the fact that, on any system the author can think of that this library would ever feasibly be used to make an application for, the address of a struct is the same as the address of its first member. This is used as a form of singular inheritance, which lays the foundation of the structure of the library.

## Using SDL_Clicky
Coming soon. The library is also under construction and lacks essentially everything except objects that can be clicked and objects that can be dragged.
If you want to delve into it already now (There is probably nobody besides me reading this), then consult the examples folder.

## Contributing
1. I don't expect it.
2. I'm too busy these days to really look through code other people write.
3. The library isn't developed enough to be ready for external contribution anyway.

## License
The library is distributed under the GPLv3 license, which is the LICENSE file, but is subject to exceptions in the LICENSE_EXCEPTIONS file.
